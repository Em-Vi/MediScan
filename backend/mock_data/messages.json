It inhibits platelet aggregation by preventing the binding of fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor, and other adhesive ligands to the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor sites on platelets.\n\n**Indications:**\n*   As an adjunct to percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) or atherectomy for the prevention of cardiac ischemic complications in patients at high risk for abrupt closure of the treated coronary vessel.\n*   Unstable angina unresponsive to conventional medical therapy when percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is planned within 24 hours.\n\n**Contraindications:**\n*   Active internal bleeding\n*   Recent (within 6 weeks) major surgery or trauma\n*   History of stroke within 2 years\n*   Thrombocytopenia\n*   Hypersensitivity to abciximab or murine proteins\n*   Severe uncontrolled hypertension\n\n**Side Effects:**\n*   **Common:** Bleeding (major and minor), thrombocytopenia, hypotension, nausea, vomiting.\n*   **Serious:** Intracranial hemorrhage, pulmonary hemorrhage, retroperitoneal bleeding, anaphylaxis.\n\n**Metabolism:**\nAbciximab is not metabolized by the liver.\n\n**Excretion:**\nThe drug is cleared from the plasma primarily via platelet binding. The unbound drug is cleared by other pathways.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n*   Abciximab is administered intravenously.\n*   Careful monitoring for bleeding is essential during and after abciximab administration.\n\nThis information is intended to support pharmacists and healthcare professionals. Always consult the full prescribing information and relevant guidelines for complete details.\n",

This action prevents the translocation of peptide chains, thus inhibiting bacterial growth.\n\n**Indications:**\n\n*   **Respiratory Tract Infections:** Acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, community-acquired pneumonia, pharyngitis/tonsillitis.\n*   **Skin and Soft Tissue Infections:** Uncomplicated skin and soft tissue infections.\n*   **Sexually Transmitted Infections:** Nongonococcal urethritis and cervicitis due to *Chlamydia trachomatis*.\n*   **Other Infections:** Acute otitis media, acute sinusitis.\n\n**Contraindications:**\n\n*   Hypersensitivity to azithromycin, erythromycin, other macrolides, or ketolides.\n*   History of cholestatic jaundice/hepatic dysfunction associated with prior azithromycin use.\n\n**Common Side Effects:**\n\n*   **Gastrointestinal:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain.\n*   **Other:** Headache, dizziness.\n\n**Serious Adverse Effects:**\n\n*   **QT Prolongation:** Can prolong the QT interval, potentially leading to torsades de pointes (a life-threatening arrhythmia). Use with caution in patients with known QT prolongation, electrolyte imbalances, or those taking other QT-prolonging drugs.\n*   **Hepatotoxicity:** Can cause liver inflammation and dysfunction.\n*   ***Clostridium difficile*-Associated Diarrhea (CDAD):** Can alter normal flora of the colon, leading to overgrowth of *C. difficile*.\n*   **Hypersensitivity Reactions:** Allergic reactions ranging from mild rash to anaphylaxis.\n\n**Metabolism and Excretion:**\n\n*   **Metabolism:** Hepatic metabolism via the cytochrome P450 system.\n*   **Excretion:** Primarily excreted unchanged in bile.\n\n**Patient Counseling Points:**\n\n*   Take azithromycin exactly as prescribed by your doctor. Do not stop taking it early, even if you feel better.\n*   Azithromycin can be taken with or without food.\n*   Report any signs of liver problems (e.g., yellowing of skin/eyes, dark urine, severe abdominal pain) to your doctor immediately.\n*   Seek immediate medical attention if you experience an irregular heartbeat, dizziness, or fainting.\n*   If you develop diarrhea, especially if it is watery or bloody, contact your doctor.\n*   Store at room temperature away from moisture and heat.\n\n**Alternative Medications:**\n\n*   **Other Macrolides:** Clarithromycin, erythromycin.\n*   **Tetracyclines:** Doxycycline, tetracycline.\n*   **Fluoroquinolones:** Levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin (use should be reserved for when other options are not suitable due to potential side effects).\n*   **Beta-Lactams:** Amoxicillin, cephalexin.\n\n**Disclaimer:** This information is intended for informational purposes only and does not substitute professional medical advice. Always consult with a qualified healthcare provider for diagnosis and treatment.\n",
